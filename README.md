## MAL Fansub data organizer

Organizes fansub data for anime that has since been removed by myanimelist.net ([Original page](https://myanimelist.net/fansub-groups.php?letter= )).

Website data courtesy of Reddit User [u/Fireraga](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fireraga) and [u/iBzOtaku](https://www.reddit.com/user/iBzOtaku) who scraped & organized it before the site went down on this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/9iq8yu/myanimelist_fansubs_archive/).

The output is a big `.txt` file organized as :
```
<Show name>
<Group1> - <Rating>
<Group2> - <Rating>
...
```
Some shows have a few groups listed twice - I think this is because the MAL fansub pages had 2 or more webpages with the same group name.

Free to fork and modify code as needed.
