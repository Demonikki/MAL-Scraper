## MAL Fansub data organizer

Organizes fansub data for anime that has since been removed by myanimelist.net ([Original page])(https://myanimelist.net/fansub-groups.php?letter= ).

Website data courtesy of Reddit User [u/Fireraga](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fireraga) who scraped & organized it before the site went down.

Output is a big .txt file Organized with show names, the groups that subbed them, and the ratings for those subs.

Some shows have a few groups listed twice - I think this is because the MAL fansub pages had 2 or more webpages with the same group name.

Free to fork and modify code as needed.
